# Real-time-hand-gesture-recognition-using-DL
This repository contains code for real-time hand gesture recognition using deep learning techniques implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. The system is capable of recognizing hand gestures in real-time from video input, enabling applications in human-computer interaction, sign language recognition for English alphabets.
Dataset
The dataset used for training the hand gesture recognition model is sourced from Kaggle and contains images of hand gestures. You can download the dataset from Kaggle - Hand Sign Images.
