# Real-time-hand-gesture-recognition-using-DL
This repository contains code for real-time hand gesture recognition using deep learning techniques implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. The system is capable of recognizing hand gestures in real-time from video input, enabling applications in human-computer interaction, sign language recognition for English alphabets.
